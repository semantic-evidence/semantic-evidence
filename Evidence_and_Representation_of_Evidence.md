# Scientific evidence #

Scientific evidence, as a concept, can be defined as **information that is relevant to assess the likelihood that a particular scientific idea is correct**.

### Representation of the corresponding evidence is therefore key to evaluating hypotheses and assessing claims contained in scientific articles, databases or any other repository of scientific information. ###

**Scientific knowledge** is often highly **context-dependent** and **based on evidence obtained from the skilful combination and evaluation of individual results**, involving, among other aspects, diverse experimental and computational techniques, different forms of interpretation, and various inference schemes.

Consequently, all those aspects - the **materials, methods and information sources used, the observations made, the reasoning employed and the context-specific assumptions made - are important for comprehensive evidence accounts**.

Likewise, when data, often from disparate sources, is integrated to study complex systems an account of the evidence that was used to infer a model's properties and those of and among its components is critical for correct and transparent understanding of that model.

## Representing scientific evidence ##
SEE represents evidence for a scientific claim in terms of the **argumentative structure of its supporting background** using **four minimal elements** for representing:

  1. **scientific claims** and the **argumentative structure** used to justify them by other claims
  1. the **subjects of the claims** i.e. of that _what_ is claimed with regard to a subject of inquiry
  1. the **agents** making the claims and arguments
  1. the **sources** in which claims were originally made e.g., the original scientific articles or database records.
